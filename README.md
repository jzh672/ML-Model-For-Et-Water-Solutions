# ML Model For Ethanol-Water Solutions

## Introduction

Based on Section 1, here is a concise overview of the project:

This project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict the safe mole fraction of ethanol in ethanol-water solutions to prevent container explosions by accurately modeling vapor pressure.

The Core Problem:

Ethanol solutions are widely used in industries like pharmaceuticals and food.

Their vapor pressure is a critical safety property; if it exceeds a container's limit, it can cause an explosion.

Traditional theoretical models like Raoult's Law and Henry's Law are inaccurate for non-ideal solutions, which ethanol-water solutions are.

The Proposed Solution:

Leverage Machine Learning to create a more accurate model that predicts the relationship between ethanol mole fraction and vapor pressure for these non-ideal solutions.

The goal is to determine a safe ethanol concentration that keeps vapor pressure within safe limits, a task where classical models fail.
